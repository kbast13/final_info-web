				<h1>Deathnote's Live Action:<br/>
				Stop Letting The West Write Down The Names</h1>

	  			<p class="indent">Again, the West has proven an inability to create live action iterations of strong anime franchises. Honestly the resulting contrast of Deathnote’s Netflix movie, and Deathnote’s anime series, is just another example of too much toying with something that was perfected in the first place. Taking into account that there was a goal of throwing an American twist on the Japanese set story line and legitimizing some of the content, the over all piece is a deteriorated version of Deathnote’s extravagance. The changed countenance of the live action Movie does not supplement the aspects of the anime that made it popular. Important features like Light, aka Kira’s, meticulous intelligence and unwavering resolve, L’s cautious nature and determination, the indifference of Ryuk through the reign of Kira and many other key aspects are all removed. In fact the facets that have been changed to suit this new American template only dilute the brilliance of the story with pandering techniques that likely turned every true fans stomach.</p>
	  			<p class="indent">There is an abundant list of what was wrong with the live action movie, some of which could have worked if delivered properly, whereas others only further cemented the West’s ineptitude at producing anime. For example, the characters in the live action do not deliver or even develop as detailed as they do on the Anime. Even characters that are original to the piece are incorrectly placed which only ruins the curve lifted by positive features. Mia Sutton (Margaret Qualley), the rebellious “smoking a cigarette on the cheer tower” cheer leader is one of these stand out flaws of the film. She changed Light’s persona by her contrast, the characters clash in a created sexual focus rather than the intelligence based hierarchy. This is glaringly contrasted to miss Amane’s blind loyalty to Light, which compliments her ditsy nature. The effect served to highlight Light’s superiority among the masses due to his god like presence to the world influence possesses by miss Amane. The resulting change in definition of Light’s role created a lacking intensity of his character that was lost in the live action piece.</p>
				<p class="indent">Light Turner’s father, James Turner lacks the dignity of Soichiro Yagami. The police chief of the NPA, maintained a strong family with a wife and two kids, was morally determined that justice needed to come to Kira, and has the image of respect and success as a police officer. This differs from his live action counter part where the train sided rickety house, sluggish behaviour and absence of wife and daughter create a seemingly forced family identity of the American policemen motiph in Western media and emphasized something unnecessary to the story. The new narrative is irrelevant to Light’s conflict as it was not within his household, but more with the moral conflict of his power. Adding the degradation of his home life, only created an extra trope that did nothing to elevate the plot.</p>
				<p class="indent">Deathnote (2017) should be added to the list of reasons as to why western companies will never be able to lead the endeavour of bringing anime adaptations to life; at least while producers and directors think it is acceptable to put their own twist on the story. Deathnote suffered the same fate of taking canon and originality and throwing them together in a mixing pot and thinking the popularity will carry the changes. Avatar: The Last Airbender (2010) had the director and the series background, to drive four movies; and it bombed. Dragon Ball Evolutions (2009) made the excitement of a long lasting series look beyond comical and essentially ridiculous; and I know you’re thinking about the elf-cross-the Leader (Marvel) version of Piccolo. Even Scarlett Johansson’s highly anticipated Ghost in A Shell (2017), fell under standard, despite her proven ability to play a Meta human, assassin (Lucy, Avengers).</p>
				<p class="indent">Ask any fan of anime, manga, video games, or even comic books, the following behind the industry is always limitless and diverse, and definitely loyal. These are some of the most devoted fans of entertainment society has to offer, and as such they do not like it when their franchises are dishonoured or ruined. So what does the West do to get involved in the anime fan based financial explosion happening through out the western world? Create some live action interpretations. On paper these ideas are brilliant, but none of the projects seem able to gain traction. Avatars, Saiyans, and now a pseudo god aspired wunderkind, have missed their shot of being the next years franchise super stars all due to the continued lacklustre attempts of cinematic crossover.</p>
