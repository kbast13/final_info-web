				<h1>Nintendo Switch's Golden Opportunity</h1>

				<p>Dec 5, 2017 @11:41am</p>

				<p>Dave Thier, Forbes</p>

  				<p class="indent">Here's something I really didn't think I would be doing here in 2017: buying The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. The game came out years ago, after all, and I've already spent dozens of hours traipsing across its frozen wilds becoming an unkillable God over and over again. I even bought it when it came out for the PS4, though I didn't play it much. I really thought I was all Skyrim-ed out, as did, I would imagine, the general gaming populace. And yet here we are again, generating hype and buzz over the release of a six-year-old game still not nearly old enough for nostalgia. The reason is simple: Bethesda released Skyrim on the Nintendo Switch, and all of a sudden everything old is new again.</p>
				<p class="indent">This release in itself feels unremarkable: Bethesda has clearly shown a commitment to releasing Skyrim on every platform known to man, and there's no reason that the Nintendo Switch should be left out. But something feels different this time around, and it points to just how successful Nintendo has been in crafting a unique product with the Switch. The ability to play one of the most fully-realized RPGs ever created on a handheld device makes it feel like an entirely new experience, and I want to jump back in again not because of curiosity but because of excitement. Because things actually do feel different when you have them on the Switch.</p>
				<p class="indent">Skyrim's release reveals an interesting truth about my relationship with the Nintendo Switch: namely that I'm willing to play basically anything on it. Porting games to a handheld, particularly games that we've only ever conceived of as full-fledged console games, has a way of making something feel genuinely fresh. And that means that the options for ports onto the Switch are suddenly limitless: what if I could play Bioshock at the gym? Or what about the original Dark Souls at a bar? I wouldn't mind playing any number of Assassin's Creed games again, and the Switch provides the perfect impetus for doing so. Maybe Sleeping Dogs? Sleeping Dogs was great. Bethesda has shown that the Switch is capable of handling Doom, a game built from the ground up for current-generation consoles. It doesn't mean that every current-gen game will work on Switch, but it should mean that there are plenty of options to choose from.</p>
				<p class="indent">Nintendo should be committing this whole hog: I want to play Wind Waker on this console, I want to play New Super Mario Bros. U, I want to play every game that I already own on my SNES Classic Edition. I'd buy them all again. I'd build an embarrassing backlog just waiting for the next long flight I find myself on. I'd rather not play any games on any platforms besides the Switch at this point, even if I know that this is somewhat unrealistic. But still, I'd expect the Switch's library to expand in a new direction soon. Shortly after launch, a flood of indie titles populated the app store hoping to take advantage of the excitement surrounding the new console. Next, I think we're going to see a flood of ports as publishers realize that releasing older games on Nintendo's eShop can breathe new life into forgotten titles.</p>
				<p class="indent">And in the end, I think this is good for the gaming industry: the relentless forward pressure that hypes up sub-standard new releases while devaluing better, older games feels like its subsiding, and the Switch could prove to be a powerful catalyst in that direction. I'm off to restart my farm in Stardew Valley.</p>
