				<h1>Avatar: Through The Eyes of The Avatar</h1>

  				<p class="indent">The Na’vi from Avatar are an example of James Cameron’s ability to immerse the audience of his pictures in to the character’s very being and experiences. The piece Avatar is a representation of colonialism and profiteering under the imperialist movements of history traverses through the expanded understanding of science fiction. The use of Avatars, artificial physical vessels of the human cultural immersion team’s psyche, works quite literally as a “shoe” that human characters “step into” to bridge the separation between the two species. A resulting reading that can be taken from the piece is that the invasion perspective comes from a familiar viewpoint as the evil is humanized. Supplement to the humanization of the foreign threat is the dehumanization of the victim by extracting humanity from the oppressed position. Cameron’s Avatar is a colonial narrative with the fortunate result of blockbuster status due to its innovative cinematography. The piece plays humanity as the aggressor when humanity is usually the victim if not split as victim and oppressor in an internal struggle. The Avatar’s in the movie are the visual example of the symbolism of the piece’s immersion idea, which allows the audience to truly connect to the plight of the story.</p>
				<p class="indent">The title of Avatar’s story is essentially the beginning of the audience’s immersion. Cameron is known for his ability to submerge the audience in his story’s universe. The title takes the first step by definition as “Avatar” is the artificial representation of a person or being in another existence. In stories about deities, they venture into the world of men through human “Avatars”. In the modern era, people create “Avatars” to represent them in the digital world. Humanity has understood the use of “Avatars” as representation for a long time, and therefore Cameron’s use of the concept can be grasped easily to allow audience connectivity to his greater story. The “walk in my shoes” ideology is entrenched in the piece due to this use of the “Avatar” concept. A bridge is created between the species via the “Avatar” gate, allowing characters to interact beyond the lines and breaking the restrictions often placed in conflicts of interest. Language, physical attributes, and cultural norms, are all means of separation between the foreign powers and the natives in every piece that discusses imperialism. For the Na’vi and the Human’s who visit, the lines are drawn clearly at the start and broken through this use of the artificial vessel.</p> 
				<p class="indent">“As a technology, cinema contributed to the (profoundly ideological) narrative of Western Civilisation and progress” . Bould’s input is that the West is often represented as the society to rise against an oppressor. This is not to say that the West is not also an aggressor, but it cannot be ignored its continuous participation in colonialist type movies. The heights of colonialism came around the late 19th century stepping into the early 20th century. In this time America was securing itself as the dominant source of Western culture; a mantle that had previously been owned by England or other parts of Northern Europe. The narrative was often based on the idea that the West was the source of moral stability, cultural progression, and general societal growth. Cameron has flipped this trend “Avatar” by having the human’s (representing the West as a seemingly American dominant company) take the position of aggressors. The humanitarian environmentalist scientists involved in the project gap the bridge, but to the company they are merely a means of communication and are largely disregarded for their importance. The scientists who seek peaceful terms with the Na’vi are evidently outliers to what Cameron appears to be attempting to portray humanity as the invaders. However, the “sky people” as they are called, are evidence of a role reversal, where the “aliens” to humanity are the ones being oppressed by the power of the Avatar’s “Western” civilization.</p>
				<p class="indent">To facilitate this idea of humanity being the imperialist representative of the West, the victims needed to be dehumanize to create a new viewpoint for the audience differing from previous experiences in cinema. Cameron’s Avatar shows similarities to movies like Braveheart (1995) and Pocahontas (1995) for example, where the oppressed are people of underdeveloped societies going against the time periods leading power. Both movies share the common antagonist in Imperialist England, and considering America’s dominance in cinema, making England the bad guy seems hardly difficult. However, this is a point of Cameron’s motive in the piece. The West of the time, while bringing advancement and innovation, has intentions that ignore the core of empathy that human’s possess. Gold, land, or in Avatar’s case, Unobtainium, create catalyst for conflict due to the personal gain sort after by the antagonist party. Where most pieces relative to this discussion have either made humanity the group on the defence from foreign invaders or humanity be split into the oppressor and the oppressed, Avatar has turned the conflict around on Humanity putting them as the sole antagonist imposing themselves upon another species. “Avatar is one of a number of recent science fiction to explore, in more or less direct ways through narrative device of encounters between humans and aliens”.</p> 
				<p class="indent">The relationship between Humans and the Na’vi is made hostile purely by the difference of ideology between the two groups. The Na’vi illustrate a society still committed to health of the world, whereas humanity has advanced in a way that ignores the needs of other species and the environment. The corporate oppressor motif is regularly used in films topically related to social justice for the disadvantaged, or environment based pieces. These films however, generally pit a greedy corporate party against other people who seek to preserve the morally right aspects of society. Similarly, imperialist campaign movies are centred on the idea that the invading force which is more advanced, and almost more hostile, are to defended against to preserve what is right for the defending civilization. This often comes with a bridging aspect of maybe the hero being the bridge themself or even them finding a means to create a bridge metaphorically between the species, either to defeat the invaders or come to an understanding. The internal struggle represented in human versus human pieces, as stated goes by the standard of moral conflict within humanity. However, in Avatar, the internal struggle is used to facilitate the bridge between the overlying struggle of humanity’s evil and the Na’vi’s tribal peace. The piece embodies Cameron’s goal of discussing the social clashing of imperialism and the morally right, which he does by highlight the loss of humanity to experience what humanity has destroyed in it’s greed.</p>
				<p class="indent">The colonial narrative of Avatar gained its success through Cameron’s innovative use of new cinema technology and quality of story. The depth of discussion that Cameron produces in the piece is a representation of colonialism and profiteering under the imperialist movements of history traverses through the expanded understanding of science fiction. With no limitations to the creativity, he was able to make a movie that turned the perspective away from the usual and gave it a new viewpoint. The West had changed its persona from imperialist empires expanding territory, to corporate gluttony seeking to attain expanses of resources and profit. In addition, with the use of the Avatar motif, a direct symbolism is created where it is only possible to understand the plight of another if you can see the world through their eyes, in as literal a sense as possible. This is an impossibility that has been the sought after answer of all oppressive conflicts in society both in the fictional and real world.</p>
